            <h2 class="week-title">Aim of the project: Investigating the rise of populism in OECD countries</h2>
            <p class="week-description"> Understanding the evolution of populism and the driving factors behind its increase in developed economies is an important step towards ensuring a more effective governance, and, in turn, a more stable democracy. As shown in chart 1., populism is in an upward trend among OECD countries, starting from 2013, after being relatively stable, low level.
                <br> In this project, I provide insights related to this trend through data visualisations and analysis. I explore the geographic distribution of populism, the relationship between populism and government quality, economic factors, and immigration impact. I also discuss the implications of these findings for future policy considerations.

                    <h3 class="chart-title">1. The rise of populism</h3>
                    <p>This chart illustrates the evolution of populist discourse in OECD countries from 2000 to 2022, with a projection extending to 2028. Based on speeches from national leaders, the data reveals a compelling story of how populist rhetoric has transformed over two decades. Starting from a relatively low score of 0.10 in 2000, the discourse maintained a stable pattern through the first decade, hovering between 0.15 and 0.20. However, a significant shift occurred around 2012, marking the beginning of a steep upward trajectory. <br>
                        The most dramatic increase in populist discourse occurred between 2012 and 2020, during which the score more than doubled, ultimately reaching its peak of nearly 0.40 in 2020. This unprecedented surge represents the highest level of populist rhetoric recorded in the measured period. Following this peak, there was a notable decline by 2022, with the score dropping to approximately 0.30, marking the first significant decrease in almost a decade. <br>
                        Looking toward the future, the projection through 2028 suggests a continued but modest upward trend, as indicated by the dotted line and the accompanying uncertainty range shown in the purple shaded area. The forecast indicates that populist discourse could potentially reach levels between 0.35 and 0.40 by 2028, though with considerable uncertainty as shown by the widening purple band. <br>
                        This comprehensive analysis, sourced from the Harvard Dataverse Global Populism Database, provides valuable insights into the changing nature of political discourse across OECD nations and suggests that while populist rhetoric has somewhat declined from its 2020 peak, it remains significantly higher than the levels observed at the turn of the millennium.</p>

                    <h3 class="chart-title">2. Geographic distribution of populism (2000-2022)</h3>
                    <p> The slider allows for investigating from 2000 to 2022 the geographic distribution of populism in OECD countries. <br>
                        This world map visualization depicts the varying levels of populist discourse across OECD countries, based on data from the Hawkins et al. (2019) Global Populism Database. The map uses a brown color gradient scale ranging from 0.0 to 1.5 to represent populism scores, with darker shades indicating higher levels of populist discourse. <br>
                        In North America, we can observe a notable gradient where Canada shows a darker brown shade, suggesting higher populist discourse levels compared to the United States, which appears in a lighter beige tone. Other OECD members like Australia also display relatively high populism scores, as indicated by the darker brown coloring. <br>                        
                        In Europe, several countries are highlighted in varying shades of brown, indicating different levels of populist rhetoric in their political discourse. Japan, as the only highlighted Asian nation in the OECD, also shows a presence of populist discourse. Chile, in South America, is also highlighted, representing its status as an OECD member with measured populist tendencies. <br>
                        The map effectively illustrates the global distribution of populist discourse across OECD nations, with non-OECD countries shown in grey as they are not included in the analysis. This visualization helps us understand the geographical patterns of populist rhetoric in developed democracies, showing that populism is not confined to any single region but varies in intensity across different OECD member states. <br>            
                        The scale at the top of the map, ranging from 0.0 to 1.5, provides a quantitative measure of populism intensity, allowing for direct comparisons between different countries' experiences with populist political discourse.</p>

                    <p>Analysis of which nations have experienced the most significant increases in populist sentiment. This map visualizes the absolute change in populist discourse scores across OECD countries between their first and last available measurements. The scale ranges from -0.50 to 1.00, with colors ranging from brown (negative change) through light beige (minimal change) to dark teal (significant positive change). <br>
                        The most striking feature is the significant increase in populist discourse in North America, particularly in the United States and Alaska, shown in dark teal, indicating a substantial positive change in populist rhetoric over the measured period. Canada, in contrast, shows a lighter shade, suggesting a more modest increase. <br>
                        In Europe, we can observe varying degrees of change across different countries, with most showing lighter shades indicating smaller changes. One notable exception appears to be a country in Eastern Europe shown in dark green, indicating a substantial increase in populist discourse. <br>
                        Australia appears in a light beige tone, suggesting relatively minimal change in populist discourse over the period. Japan is also visible on the map with a slight coloration, indicating some change in its populist discourse levels. <br>
                        The color scale at the top of the map is particularly informative, showing that changes range from a decrease of up to 0.50 points (brown) to an increase of up to 1.00 points (dark teal). This helps quantify the magnitude of change in populist rhetoric across these nations. <br>
                        When viewed alongside the previous maps and time series, this visualization adds an important dimension to understanding how populist discourse has evolved differently across OECD nations, highlighting which countries have experienced the most significant shifts in their political rhetoric.</p>

                    <h3 class="chart-title">4. Populism and government quality</h3>
                    <p>Examining the relationship between populist movements and governance effectiveness metrics.<br>
                        This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between Populism Score and Government Effectiveness across OECD countries from 2000 to 2022, drawing data from both the World Bank and Hawkins et al. (2019) databases. <br>
                        The x-axis represents the Populism Score, ranging from 0.0 to 1.8, while the y-axis shows Government Effectiveness scores, spanning from -2.0 to 2.5. Each dot on the plot represents a country at a specific point in time, with different colors likely representing different countries or years. <br>                        
                        A key feature of the visualization is the dotted blue trend line, which shows a negative correlation between populism and government effectiveness. This suggests that, on average, countries with higher populism scores tend to have lower government effectiveness ratings. <br>                        
                        The data points are particularly concentrated in the lower populism score range (0.0-0.4), with government effectiveness scores varying widely in this range from about -1.5 to 2.0. As populism scores increase beyond 0.4, there appears to be both fewer data points and a tendency toward lower government effectiveness scores. <br>                        
                        The visualization reveals several interesting patterns: we can observe a dense cluster of observations with populism scores below 0.4 and moderate to high government effectiveness ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. The data becomes more scattered and shows generally lower government effectiveness scores as populism increases. There are some notable outlier cases with high populism scores above 1.0 showing varying levels of government effectiveness. The trend line consistently suggests a gradual decline in government effectiveness as populism increases. <br>                        
                        This visualization effectively captures the complex relationship between populist political discourse and the practical effectiveness of governance in OECD nations over more than two decades, suggesting that higher levels of populist rhetoric may be associated with decreased governmental effectiveness.</p>

                    <p>Investigation of economic indicators and their correlation with populist trends. SI POTREBBE GUARDARE GDP Per capita, vedi paper recession e populism growth e menziona. <br>
                        This dual-axis line graph tracks the relationship between populist discourse and GDP across OECD countries from 2000 to 2022. The visualization displays two distinct metrics: GDP PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) on the left y-axis, shown in blue, ranging from 11.80 to 12.40, and populist discourse values on the right y-axis, shown in red, ranging from 0 to 0.50. <br>
                        The GDP trend, represented by the blue line, shows a generally steady upward trajectory over the 22-year period, with some minor fluctuations. It begins around 12.10 in 2000 and reaches approximately 12.28 by 2022, indicating overall economic growth across OECD nations. <br>                        
                        The populist discourse trend, shown by the red line, exhibits more dramatic variations. It starts at about 0.10 in 2000 and remains relatively stable until 2012, hovering around 0.15-0.20. However, from 2012 onwards, there's a marked increase in populist rhetoric, climbing steadily to reach a peak of about 0.40 in 2020. Notably, there's a sharp decline after 2020, dropping to around 0.30 by 2022. <br>                        
                        What's particularly interesting is the relationship between these two metrics: while GDP shows consistent growth, populist discourse experiences much more volatile changes, especially in the latter part of the period. This suggests that the rise in populist rhetoric occurred independently of economic growth, as GDP continued its upward trend even during periods of significant changes in populist discourse. <br>                        
                        The data, based on speeches from national leaders and GDP PPP measurements, provides a compelling picture of how economic performance and political rhetoric have evolved in parallel across OECD nations during this period.</p>

                    <p>This bar chart shows the distribution of migration-related news articles from 2000 to 2024, with data collected from newspaper publications using ProQuest TDM. The y-axis represents the number of articles, ranging from 0 to 4,000, while the x-axis shows the progression of years. <br>
                        The trend reveals a significant evolution in media coverage of migration over these 24 years. From 2000 to 2012, the number of articles remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 600 and 1,200 articles per year. However, starting from 2013, there's a notable upward trend in coverage. <br>
                        The most dramatic increase occurs between 2017 and 2018, with the number of articles reaching a peak of approximately 3,600 in 2018. After this peak, there's a slight decline in 2019, followed by another decrease in 2020. The years 2021-2024 show considerable fluctuation, with the most recent data point in 2024 showing around 3,200 articles. <br>
                        This pattern suggests a significant intensification of media attention to migration issues over time, particularly in the latter half of the 2010s. The sharp increase from 2013 onwards could reflect growing public and media interest in migration issues, possibly coinciding with various global events and policy changes affecting migration patterns. <br>
                        Notably, the substantial increase in coverage aligns with the timeline we observed in the previous charts showing the rise in populist discourse, suggesting a possible correlation between media coverage of migration and the growth of populist rhetoric in OECD countries.</p>

                    <p>This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between Migration News Coverage and Populism scores from 2000-2022, while controlling for GDP. The visualization includes several key elements: <br>
                        The x-axis shows the Number of Migration News Articles, ranging from 0 to 4,000, while the y-axis displays the Populism Score from 0.14 to 0.40. Each point on the plot is color-coded according to Log(GDP), with a scale ranging from 11.9 (purple) to 12.4 (yellow), as shown in the legend on the right. <br>
                        A striking feature is the strong positive correlation between migration news coverage and populism scores, indicated by the dotted blue trend line. This relationship is quantified by an R² value of 0.741, suggesting that approximately 74.1% of the variation in populism scores can be explained by the number of migration news articles, when controlling for GDP. <br>
                        The data points show a clear pattern: as the number of migration news articles increases, there is a corresponding rise in populism scores. The points are relatively tightly clustered around the trend line, particularly in the lower ranges of news coverage (around 800 articles). As the number of articles increases, we see higher populism scores, with some data points showing populism scores above 0.35 when news coverage exceeds 3,000 articles. <br>
                        The color gradient of the points adds another dimension to the analysis, showing how GDP levels relate to both variables. The variation in colors across the plot suggests that this relationship between migration news coverage and populism exists across different levels of economic development within OECD countries. <br>
                        This visualization effectively demonstrates a strong statistical relationship between media coverage of migration and the rise of populist discourse, while accounting for economic factors through GDP control.</p>

            <p>The analysis draws on four primary data sources to investigate populism in OECD countries from 2000 to 2022. The foundation of the populism measurements comes from <a href="https://populism.byu.edu/0000017d-bf5d-d270-a1fd-ff5fcf750001/global-populism-database-paper-pdf">Hawkins et al. (2019)</a> Global Populism Database (last updated in 2022), which provides ratings of government leaders' speeches on a scale from 0 (not populist) to 2 (very populist). This dataset focuses specifically on heads of government rather than political parties or other figures, with varying temporal coverage across countries. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelo-leone/angelo-leone.GitHub.io/refs/heads/main/gpd_v2_20220427.csv"> Download data. </a> <br>
                Government effectiveness metrics were sourced from the <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/worldwide-governance-indicators/Series/GE.EST">World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators</a>, which measure perceptions of public service quality, civil service independence, policy implementation, and government credibility on a scale from -2.5 to 2.5. Economic data was obtained from the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelo-leone/angelo-leone.GitHub.io/refs/heads/main/a3bee049-01af-4985-b2d2-42694bee774c_Data.csv">World Bank's World Development Indicators</a> database, specifically focusing on GDP PPP figures for the selected OECD countries. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelo-leone/angelo-leone.GitHub.io/refs/heads/main/2d540c87-490f-487f-a55f-ad766f804aa1_Data.csv">Download Government Effectiveness data.</a><br>
                For media coverage analysis, data was collected using ProQuest TDM to extract news articles from 2000 to 2022 relating to migration topics, including terms like "irregular migrations" and "illegal immigration." All datasets are publicly accessible via GitHub, enabling replication of the analysis.

            <h2 class="week-title">Challenges in data cleaning and analysis</h3>
            <p>Here is a 200-word overview of the data challenges and solutions encountered during the project:

                The analysis presented several technical challenges across different visualization stages. For the time series analysis of populism (Chart 1), the primary difficulty lay in standardizing the populism database, which contained multiple speeches per year without specific dates and was organized by leaders rather than countries. This was resolved using pandas DataFrame manipulations to aggregate scores at the country-year level. <br>                
                The geographical visualizations (Charts 2 and 3) required careful attention to data standardization, particularly in matching ISO3 codes with the Vega topojson file. Additional challenges with Vega's slider functionality were overcome by adapting solutions from previous mapping implementations. <br>                
                The correlation analyses (Charts 4 and 5) involved merging multiple datasets while maintaining data integrity. A particular challenge arose with y-axis labeling in Vega, which was addressed through alternative visual cues and enhanced tooltips. The migration news analysis (Chart 6) required precise querying in ProQuest TDM to ensure data relevance and reliability. <br>                
                The final visualization (Chart 7) presented the challenge of effectively displaying three-dimensional relationships. This was resolved by using year as the grouping variable for populism scores and migration news counts, while incorporating GDP data through color-coding based on log values. <br>                
                All challenges were overcome through a combination of pandas data manipulation, careful database querying, and creative visualization techniques in Vega-Lite.</p>

            <h2 class="week-title">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Summary of findings and implications for future policy considerations.<br>
                Based on our comprehensive analysis of populism in OECD countries, several significant insights emerge that help us understand its evolution and driving factors in developed economies. <br>
                The temporal analysis reveals a clear inflection point around 2012-2013, after which populist discourse experienced a marked increase from previously stable, low levels. This surge continued until reaching a peak in 2020, followed by a slight decline. The geographical distribution shows considerable variation across OECD nations, with some countries experiencing more dramatic increases than others, particularly in North America and parts of Europe. <br>           
                A crucial finding emerges from the analysis of government effectiveness and populist discourse. The negative correlation between these variables suggests that higher levels of populism are associated with decreased governmental effectiveness, raising important concerns about the potential impact on democratic institutions and governance quality. <br>
                Interestingly, the relationship between populism and economic performance, as measured by GDP, appears more complex and less direct than might be expected. While GDP has shown consistent growth across OECD countries, populist discourse has followed its own distinct pattern, suggesting that economic factors alone do not fully explain the rise in populism. <br>
                Perhaps most significantly, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between migration-related news coverage and populist discourse (R² = 0.741, controlling for GDP). The dramatic increase in migration-related news articles from 2013 onwards closely mirrors the rise in populist rhetoric, suggesting that media coverage of migration issues may play a crucial role in shaping populist sentiments. <br>
                These findings have important implications for policy considerations and democratic stability. They suggest that addressing the rise of populism requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond purely economic solutions. Special attention should be paid to the role of media coverage in shaping public discourse, the importance of maintaining effective governance structures, and the need to address migration-related concerns in a balanced and constructive manner. <br>
                For future policy considerations, these insights suggest the need for: strengthening democratic institutions, developing more effective approaches to migration communication and policy, maintaining focus on government effectiveness, and fostering a more balanced public discourse on complex social issues. This comprehensive understanding of populism's driving factors provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to ensure more stable and effective democratic governance in OECD nations.</p>
