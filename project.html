                \n2. the data you used, how you accessed it, including notes on automation/replication; PROJECT TIP: you should comment on your data sources. This should go beyond simply stating the source, "World Bank, 2020". In a DS project you should know in detail how the data are collected and how reliable they are. 
                \n3. challenges in data cleaning and/or analysis, and the tools you used to overcome them: didn't have a date for each speech so I had to create a different df with a speech for each year that is included in yearbegin and yearend of each speech. Also, it contained yearend until 2037 or something, I removed and kept until 2022 because the version was until 2022. Used pandas for data cleaning and altair for plotting. I imported the json file to github. Data coverage is limited, meaning that not all countries have data for each year, minimum 8 in 2000 and maximum 25 in 2012 for example. SPEECH Data only inclued leaders not other parties that are maybe in parliament and have power but not leader of government, so might minimize actuali populist level. Think of France whee in power you have not populist but the elections were won by populists basically (Lepen). Infatti, se si vede https://popu-list.org/ potrebbe essere meglio. Magari provo.

                3. challenges in data cleaning and/or analysis, and the tools you used to overcome them; Not clear why so many populism score 0 value for 2572 speeches. That's not my problem. I had to melt gov effectiveness database, group the populism databse and merge databases.

                1. description of the chart and aim of the analysis. Not clear if coorelated, but interesting to see after 2012 there is a growth in populism, especially as financial crisis came to europe in that period even if OECD gdp was recovering already. Maybe we can see what exactly drove growth in populism? Which countries?
